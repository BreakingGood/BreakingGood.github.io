# BreakingGood.github.io

This is a simple portfolio website that I made for myself as a personal project. It is my first attempt at HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It currently uses Jquery, but I am in the process of adjusting the code so that only vanilla Javascript is used. 

The focus of the project was maximum performance, particularly on mobile devices. The website has full mobile device and tablet support.
